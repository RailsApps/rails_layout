h1. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/rails-36x36.jpg(RailsLayout Gem)! RailsLayout Gem

Use this gem to set up layout files for your choice of front-end framework:

* Zurb Foundation 5.3
* Bootstrap 4.0
* Bootstrap 3.3

It also will set up "Devise":https://github.com/plataformatec/devise views with styling for Bootstrap or Foundation.

RailsLayout is a utility gem to use during development.

h4. Other Tools

The RailsLayout gem is used by "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool, an application template used to create starter applications. You can use Rails Composer to generate entire applications.

If you like the RailsLayout gem, you might be interested in the "RailsApps Testing gem":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_testing which sets up a testing framework for Rails.

h2. Installing a Front-End Framework

Refer to instructions for:

* "Foundation and Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-foundation.html
* "Bootstrap and Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/twitter-bootstrap-rails.html

In summary, to install a front-end framework, add the gems you need. Then use the RailsLayout gem. It will set up your assets files.

Add the gems you need to your Rails application Gemfile:

h4. Zurb Foundation 5.3

<pre>
gem 'foundation-rails'
</pre>

See a note below about a necessary change to the *config/application.rb* file.

h4. Zurb Foundation 4.0

<pre>
gem 'compass-rails'
gem 'zurb-foundation'
</pre>

h4. Bootstrap 4.0

<pre>
gem 'bootstrap', '~> 4.0.0.alpha3.1'
</pre>

h4. Bootstrap 3.3

<pre>
gem 'bootstrap-sass'
</pre>

h4. Bootstrap 2.3

<pre>
gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 2.3.2.2'
</pre>

h4. Use Bundler

Use Bundler to install the gem:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

h2. Install the RailsLayout Gem

Add it to your Rails application Gemfile:

<pre>
group :development do
  gem 'rails_layout'
end
</pre>

You don't need the gem deployed to production, so put it in the @development@ group.

If you want to use a newer unreleased version from GitHub:

<pre>
group :development do
  gem 'rails_layout', github: 'RailsApps/rails_layout'
end
</pre>

Use Bundler to install the gem:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

h2. The "layout:install" Command

The command will rename *application.css* to *application.css.scss*.

It will add:

* *1st_load_framework.css.scss*

The Rails asset pipeline loads asset files in alphabetical order (unless the assets are specified explicitly in the manifest file). The file is named @1st_load_framework.css.scss@ so the framework will be loaded first before any custom CSS files added by the developer.

And modify the JavaScript asset file:

* *application.js*

It will set up a default application layout.

It creates partials for:

* Rails flash messages
* navigation links

Additionally, if Devise or OmniAuth is present, the command will add Sass mixins to accommodate forms. The Sass mixins add form styling to be used with either Bootstrap or Foundation (so we don't have to maintain separate views for each front-end framework).

h4. Supported Frameworks

You can generate layout files suitable for use with the following front-end frameworks:

* @foundation5@ - Zurb Foundation 5.3
* @foundation4@ - Zurb Foundation 4.0
* @bootstrap4@ - Bootstrap 4.0
* @bootstrap3@ - Bootstrap 3.3
* @bootstrap2@ - Bootstrap 2.3
* @simple@ - simple layout
* @none@ - removes all changes

h4. Generated Files

The RailsLayout gem generates application layout files:

* app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
* app/views/layouts/_messages.html.erb
* app/views/layouts/_navigation.html.erb
* app/views/layouts/_navigation_links.html.erb

If Devise or OmniAuth is installed, there will be an additional file:

* app/views/layouts/_nav_links_for_auth.html.erb

Additionally, when the @simple@ option is selected:

* app/assets/stylesheets/simple.css

h4. Note About the Navigation Partials

The *_navigation.html.erb* file contains framework-specific styling. Separating the files makes it easy to change the front-end framework without disturbing the links.

The *_navigation_links.html.erb* file is only a list of links. You can add additional links to this file as needed. It contains no framework-specific styling (except if you are using Bootstrap 4).

The *_nav_links_for_auth.html.erb* file is created if Devise or OmniAuth is installed.

h4. Support for ERB, Haml, or Slim

If you are using ERB for Rails views, the RailsLayout gem will generate ERB files.

If you are using Haml or Slim, the RailsLayout gem will generate Haml or Slim files instead.

h4. Additional Documentation

See these articles for information about how to set up the application layout:

* "*Rails Application Layout*":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-default-application-layout.html
* "*Rails and Bootstrap*":http://railsapps.github.io/twitter-bootstrap-rails.html
* "*Rails and Foundation*":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-foundation.html

Look at the "Learn Rails":https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails example application to see how the generated files from the RailsLayout gem are used. You'll find details about the example application in the book "Learn Ruby on Rails":http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html.

* "app/assets/javascripts/application.js":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout/blob/master/lib/generators/layout/install/templates/foundation5-application.js

h4. config/application.rb

The rails_layout gem will make a necessary change to the *config/application.rb* file. It will add:

<pre>
module RailsFoundation
  class Application < Rails::Application
    .
    .
    .
    # For Foundation 5
    config.assets.precompile += %w( vendor/modernizr )

and modify the file:

* "app/assets/javascripts/application.js":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout/blob/master/lib/generators/layout/install/templates/bootstrap-application.js

h3. Bootstrap 2.3 Layout

To create layout files for use with Bootstrap 2.3:

<pre>
$ rails generate layout:install bootstrap2
</pre>

Use @--force@ if you want to overwrite existing files:

<pre>
$ rails generate layout:install bootstrap2 --force
</pre>

and modify the file:

* "app/assets/javascripts/application.js":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout/blob/master/lib/generators/layout/install/templates/bootstrap-application.js

h3. Generate a Simple Layout

To create a set of simple layout files:

<pre>
$ rails generate layout:install simple
</pre>

Use @--force@ if you want to overwrite existing files:

<pre>
$ rails generate layout:install simple --force
</pre>

See the files that are generated:

* "app/views/layouts/application.html.erb":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout/blob/master/lib/generators/layout/install/templates/simple-application.html.erb
* "app/views/layouts/_messages.html.erb":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout/blob/master/lib/generators/layout/install/templates/simple-messages.html.erb
* "app/views/layouts/_navigation.html.erb":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout/blob/master/lib/generators/layout/install/templates/simple-navigation.html.erb
* "app/assets/stylesheets/simple.css":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout/blob/master/lib/generators/layout/install/templates/simple.css

The RailsLayout gem will create the file:

* "app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout/blob/master/lib/generators/layout/install/templates/application.css.scss

h3. Reverting to None

To revert your application to a default application layout:

<pre>
$ rails generate layout:install none
</pre>

The RailsLayout gem will remove any files it may have added:

* app/views/layouts/_messages.html.erb
* app/views/layouts/_navigation.html.erb
* app/assets/stylesheets/simple.css
* app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap_and_overrides.css.scss
* app/assets/stylesheets/foundation_and_overrides.css.scss
* app/assets/stylesheets/1st_load_framework.css.scss

Additionally, it will restore these files to the default versions:

* app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
* app/assets/javascripts/application.js

The file *app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss* will contain a CSS rule but you can ignore it or remove it.

h2. The "layout:navigation" Command

If you are using Devise or OmniAuth for authentication, you can generate a navigation links partial containing appropriate links.

This command is used to populate the navigation bar in starter applications created by the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool.

<pre>
$ rails generate layout:navigation --force
</pre>

Here's an example of a file *app/views/layouts/_nav_links_for_auth.html.erb* appropriate for Devise:

<pre>
<%# add navigation links to this file %>
<li><%= link_to 'Home', root_path %></li>
<li><%= link_to 'About', page_path('about') %></li>
<li><%= link_to 'Contact', new_contact_path %></li>
<% if user_signed_in? %>
  <li><%= link_to 'Edit account', edit_user_registration_path %></li>
  <li><%= link_to 'Sign out', destroy_user_session_path, :method=>'delete' %></li>
<% else %>
  <li><%= link_to 'Sign in', new_user_session_path %></li>
  <li><%= link_to 'Sign up', new_user_registration_path %></li>
<% end %>
<% if user_signed_in? %>
  <% if current_user.has_role? :admin %>
    <li><%= link_to 'Admin', users_path %></li>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
</pre>

The full set of links will be created if initialization files are found for Devise or OmniAuth.

h2. The "layout:devise" Command

"Devise":https://github.com/plataformatec/devise is a gem for authentication and user management (signup, login, and related features). Devise provides a utility command @rails generate devise:views@. The Devise command creates view files for signup, login, and related features. However, the views generated by Devise lack CSS styling.

Use the RailsLayout gem to generate Devise views with styling for Bootstrap or Foundation.

* @$ rails generate layout:devise foundation5@
* @$ rails generate layout:devise bootstrap3@

The command will create (or replace) these files:

* app/views/devise/sessions/new.html.erb
* app/views/devise/passwords/new.html.erb
* app/views/devise/registrations/edit.html.erb
* app/views/devise/registrations/new.html.erb

h4. Limitations

At this time, with the "layout:devise" command, only Foundation 5 or Bootstrap 3 are supported. Files are not generated for Haml or Slim.

h2. Issues
